# surfs_up
Module 9 - SQLite_SQLAlchemy_Flask

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to provide temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu. The customer, W.Avy, is looking for the weather data to determine if opening a surf and ice cream shop year round is feasible.

## Results

The temperature readings from nine different weather stations were gathered into the dataset. The datapoints were obtained between 2010 and 2017. Looking at the months of June and December during this timeframe gives the customer the data needed to determine if a year-round shop is viable.

* For June, the average temperature based on 1700 readings is 75 degrees.
* For December, the average temperature based on 1517 readings is 71 degrees.
* The lowest temperature in December was 56 degrees.

## Summary

Based on the analysis of temperature readings during June and December, the weather is very moderate year round in Oahu. If further analysis is needed, I would recommend looking at the precipation data and the wind data as both of those weather factors could affect a surf and ice cream shop.
